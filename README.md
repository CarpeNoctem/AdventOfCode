# Advent Of Code
A place to put some Advent of Code solutions

Just doing a few puzzles from https://adventofcode.com/2018/ as I get time,
and commmitting my solutions here so I can refer back to them later.

/!\ Probably none of my solutions will be good examples to borrow from - you've been warned! :)

Initially, I was dumping my solutions in [a gist](https://gist.github.com/CarpeNoctem/5b05cf59d44b6ff28aba4a14c3a3f0f7) as I went, and you can see a couple
of my Elixir learnings in [file-day-01_part-02-exs](https://gist.github.com/CarpeNoctem/5b05cf59d44b6ff28aba4a14c3a3f0f7#file-day-01_part-02-exs)
